    - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary(Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a table with some vocabulary that might be helpful), should just start showing the vocabulary table
  
    - BAD: Verb conjugation information was lacking, which might be challenging for a CEFR A1 student.
  
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?
  
    - GOOD: A table with relevant vocabulary, including verbs, adverbs, and adjectives, was provided.
  
    - GOOD: The assistant asked the student to try to put the words together to form a sentence in French.

    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a table with some vocabulary that might be helpful:
    English	| French
    bear	| ours
    to be	| être
    at	    | (think about prepositions!)
    door	| porte
    did	    | (think about verb conjugation!)
    leave	| laisser
    garbage	| déchets
    out	    | (think about prepositions!)

    Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two parts to the sentence: "Bears are at the door" and "did you leave the garbage out?".
    Possible sentence structure:
    Part 1: Subject (bears) + verb (to be) + preposition (at) + object (door)
    Part 2: Question word (did) + subject (you) + verb (leave) + object (garbage) + preposition (out)
    Your turn! Can you try to put the words together to form a sentence in French?
